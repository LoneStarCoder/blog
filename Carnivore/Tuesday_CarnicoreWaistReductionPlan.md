# Perfect Day 2 (Tuesday) - Detailed Breakdown

This is Day 2 of my plan to shrink my waist from 48 to 43 inches as fast as possible on a carnivore diet. I’m targeting 200g+ protein, 50-70g fat, and a 1,500-1,800 calorie deficit, with an eating window from 11:00 AM to 7:30 PM. I wake at 6 AM, work 8 AM to 4/5 PM, and use dumbbells and junkyard gear (tires, metal—assuming ~20-40 lbs for carries). Tuesday’s a strength day, balancing HIIT (e.g., Monday). Here’s how it unfolds.

## 6:00 AM - Wake Up
- **Hydration**: 16 oz water with a DIY electrolyte mix—1/2 tsp table salt, 1/4 tsp lite salt, 1/4 tsp magnesium citrate powder. Gives me ~1,440mg sodium, 350mg potassium, 60mg magnesium. Costs ~$0.15, way cheaper than pre-made mixes.
- **Coffee**: 2 cups black coffee (~190mg caffeine). Fires up ketosis and sharpens my AM focus.
- **Supplements**:
  - Thorne Creatine Monohydrate (5g, mixed in coffee or water). Supports muscle preservation and brain function.
  - Pure Encapsulations B12 (1,000 mcg, sublingual). Boosts energy and cognition for work.
- **Activity**: 5 min light stretching (leg swings, shoulder rolls). Keeps it fresh from Monday’s arm swings, wakes me up without strain.

## 6:30 AM - Pre-Work Prep
- **Activity**: 45 min brisk walk (3-4 mph, ~150 cal burned). Steady, low-intensity fat burn to start the day.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz water + DIY mix (1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp lite salt, 1/8 tsp Mg citrate). ~720mg sodium, 175mg potassium, 30mg magnesium.
- **Supplements**: Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (2 softgels, 1,280mg EPA/DHA). Keeps my brain sharp and aids recovery.

## 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Work (Peak Focus)
- **Work**: Hit my hardest tasks—ketones from fasting plus caffeine make this my critical thinking peak.
- **Hydration**: Sip 32 oz water + DIY mix (1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp lite salt). ~1,440mg sodium, 350mg potassium. No magnesium here to spread it out.

## 11:00 AM - Meal 1
- **Food**: 6 whole eggs + 6 oz 80/20 ground beef (pan-seared, drained). ~65g protein, 50g fat, 750 cal. Swapped Monday’s salmon for beef to mix it up—still hits my protein and fat goals.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz water + DIY mix (1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp lite salt, 1/8 tsp Mg citrate). ~720mg sodium, 175mg potassium, 30mg magnesium.

## 11:30 AM - 4:00 PM - Work (Sustained Performance)
- **Work**: Keep the momentum; sip 32 oz water + DIY mix (1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp lite salt). ~1,440mg sodium, 350mg potassium.
- **Snack (2:00 PM)**: 1 cup beef bone broth (20 cal, 5g protein). Curbs hunger, adds ~200mg sodium from the broth itself.
- **Boost (2:30 PM)**: 1 cup black coffee (~95mg caffeine) or Thorne Caffeine (100mg pill). Lifts me through the afternoon slump.

## 4:00 PM - Transition
- **Activity**: 15 min light walk (~50 cal). Decompresses me and preps my body for strength training.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz plain water. No electrolytes here—just pure hydration.

## 5:00 PM - Workout (Strength)
- **Strength**: Using dumbbells and junkyard gear for a full-body session.
  - **Warm-Up**: 5 min (arm swings, bodyweight squats).
  - **Main**:
    - *Dumbbell Goblet Squats*: Hold 1 dumbbell (10-25 lbs) at chest, squat deep. 3 sets x 8-10 reps. Hits legs and core.
    - *Tire Deadlifts*: Lift a 20-50 lb tire from ground to hip height, drop it (no slow lowering). 3 sets x 6-8 reps. Back and legs.
    - *Dumbbell Floor Press*: Lie on ground, press dumbbells (10-25 lbs/hand) up. 3 sets x 8-10 reps. Chest and arms.
    - *Metal Farmer’s Carry*: Carry a 20-40 lb metal piece (assuming this weight—adjust if heavier) 30-40 yards. 3 sets, rest 1 min. Grip and full body.
  - **Cooldown**: 5 min stretch (hamstrings, shoulders).
  - **Burn**: ~200-250 cal. Less than HIIT, but builds muscle to keep my metabolism high.
- **Pre-Workout**: Bulletproof MCT C8 Oil (10g, 90 cal) + Thorne Caffeine (100mg pill). Gives me a strength boost without carbs.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz water + DIY mix (1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp lite salt, 1/8 tsp Mg citrate). ~720mg Na, 175mg K, 30mg Mg.

## 6:00 PM - Meal 2
- **Food**: 8 oz chicken thighs (skin-on, air-fried) + 2 whole eggs. ~55g protein, 35g fat, 600 cal. Eggs keep protein climbing.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz plain water.

## 7:00 PM - Meal 3
- **Food**: 10 oz salmon (grilled). ~60g protein, 35g fat, 600 cal. Omega-3s aid recovery after strength work.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz water + DIY mix (1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp lite salt, 1/8 tsp Mg citrate). ~720mg Na, 175mg K, 30mg Mg.
- **Supplements**: Thorne Magnesium Bisglycinate (400mg). Calms me down and boosts sleep quality.

## 7:30 PM - Eating Window Closes
- **Total**: 180-190g protein, 65-70g fat, 1,650-1,760 cal. Deficit stays ~1,000-1,400 cal with ~450-500 cal burned today.

## 8:00 PM - Wind Down
- **Activity**: 30 min walk (~100 cal). Keeps my metabolism ticking post-workout.
- **Hydration**: 16 oz plain water.

## 10:00 PM - Bedtime
- **Sleep**: 8 hours (10 PM - 6 AM). Recovery’s non-negotiable—strength days need it most.
