# Weekly Food Shopping List - Carnivore Waist Reduction Plan

This covers food for Days 1-7 (Monday-Sunday), aiming for 200g+ protein, 50-70g fat, and 1,500-1,800 cal daily intake. Quantities are based on your meals (eggs, beef, chicken thighs, salmon, bone broth) across the week, assuming fresh prep daily. Adjust if you batch cook or have leftovers.

## Shopping List

### Eggs
- **Quantity**: 48 large eggs
- **Breakdown**: 
  - Mon: 8 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 10
  - Tue: 6 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 8
  - Wed: 6 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 8
  - Thu: 8 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 10
  - Fri: 6 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 8
  - Sat: 6 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 8
  - Sun: 8 (Meal 1) + 2 (Meal 2) = 10
  - Total: 10 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 62 (48 rounds to a neat 4 dozen; add more if pushing 200g protein daily)
- **Notes**: Buy in bulk (e.g., 5-dozen pack) for cost savings. Pasture-raised if budget allows.

### Ground Beef (80/20)
- **Quantity**: 48 oz (~3 lbs)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Mon: 8 oz (Meal 3)
  - Tue: 6 oz (Meal 1)

  - Thu: 8 oz (Meal 3)
  - Fri: 6 oz (Meal 1)
  - Sat: 6 oz (Meal 1)
  - Sun: 8 oz (Meal 2)
  - Total: 8 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 50 oz (~3.125 lbs, round to 3 lbs)
- **Notes**: 80/20 keeps fat in range. Grass-fed if possible; bulk packs (e.g., 5 lbs) work if freezing extras.

### Chicken Thighs (Skin-On)
- **Quantity**: 50 oz (~3.125 lbs)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Mon: 8 oz (Meal 2)
  - Tue: 8 oz (Meal 2)
  - Wed: 6 oz (Meal 1)
  - Thu: 8 oz (Meal 2)
  - Fri: 8 oz (Meal 2)
  - Sat: 8 oz (Meal 2)
  - Sun: 10 oz (Meal 3)
  - Total: 8 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 56 oz (~3.5 lbs, round to 3.125 lbs)
- **Notes**: Skin-on for fat; bone-in optional. Buy fresh or frozen packs (e.g., 4 lbs).

### Salmon (Fresh or Frozen)
- **Quantity**: 48 oz (~3 lbs)

  - Sat: 10 oz (Meal 3)
  - Sun: 4 oz (Meal 1)
  - Total: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 oz (~3.25 lbs, round to 3 lbs)
- **Notes**: Wild-caught preferred for omega-3s. Frozen fillets (e.g., 6 oz each) are cost-effective.

### Beef Bone Broth
- **Quantity**: 7 cups (~56 oz, ~1.75 quarts)
- **Breakdown**: 1 cup daily (Mon-Sun) = 7 cups
- **Notes**: Homemade (bones, water, salt) is cheapestâ€”buy beef bones (e.g., 2-3 lbs) if making. Store-bought (e.g., Kettle & Fire) works; get 2 quarts.
